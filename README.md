## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a disease prediction system using machine learning. The system takes symptom inputs as input and predicts the most likely disease using a combined model based on three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
   $ cd disease-prediction
   ```
