## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a disease prediction system using machine learning. The system takes symptom inputs as input and predicts the most likely disease using a combined model based on three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
   $ cd disease-prediction
   ```
## Usage

To use the disease prediction system, follow these steps:

```bash
   $ python main.py
```
Enter the symptoms as a comma-separated list when prompted.
The system will provide predictions using the combined model.

## Features

- Accurate disease prediction based on symptoms.
- Combined model using SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest for improved accuracy.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation and guides, please refer to the Documentation directory.
